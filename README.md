## Simple Network Topology and Static Routing
- Understand the fundamentals of network topology design and configuration.
- Implement static routing to control the flow of network traffic.

## Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP
- Explore dynamic routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP.
- Learn their features, advantages, and deployment scenarios.

## VLAN and STP
- Configure Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment network traffic logically.
- Implement Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops.

## Packet Filtering Firewall
- Set up a packet filtering firewall using industry-standard practices.
- Control inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined rulesets.

## Design and Implementation of Secure and Scalable Network Infrastructure
- Design network architectures that prioritize security and scalability.
- Implement best practices for multi-site organizations to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Red Team – Network Analysis and Pen Test
- Conduct network analysis from a red team perspective.
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and assess security posture.

## RSA Authentication
- Implement RSA-based authentication mechanisms for secure access control.
- Learn to integrate RSA tokens into the authentication process.

## Securing Data in Transit
- Encrypt network traffic to protect data confidentiality.
- Explore various encryption protocols and their implementation.

## Certificate Authority Deployment
- Deploy a Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure to manage digital certificates.
- Secure communication channels using SSL/TLS certificates.

## Remote Access VPN (Global Protect)
- Set up a Remote Access VPN solution using Global Protect.
- Enable secure remote connectivity for users accessing the network from external locations.

## Intrusion Detection System Utilizing SNORT
- Deploy SNORT as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor network traffic.
- Configure SNORT rules to detect and respond to potential security threats.
