- Understand the fundamentals of network topology design and configuration.
- Implement static routing to control the flow of network traffic.

## Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP
- Explore dynamic routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP.
- Learn their features, advantages, and deployment scenarios.

## VLAN and STP
- Configure Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment network traffic logically.
- Implement Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops.

## Packet Filtering Firewall
- Set up a packet filtering firewall using industry-standard practices.
- Control inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined rulesets.

## Design and Implementation of Secure and Scalable Network Infrastructure

The project's accomplishment lies in the intricate design of a secure network infrastructure that spans across the corporate headquarters and its two branches, ingeniously fortified with technologies like IDS/IPS, NAC, and SD-WAN. It boasts a robust arrangement of VPNs, reinforced by authentication protocols managed by certificate authorities, ensuring data integrity and operational efficiency. The network's architecture, evident from the topology, encompasses strategically placed firewalls, a meticulous VLAN structure, and dedicated security zones that embody the commitment to security and streamlined operations. The addition of IDS/IPS, the comprehensive server farm, and thorough network segmentation demonstrates a proactive approach to cybersecurity. By continuously monitoring through threat assessments and compliance with the NIST framework, the network is not only secure but also poised for future expansions, enabling the organization to maintain its strategic edge and operational agility.
